Changes made to DtCyber

Since jul25 drop:

- Added 029 card code support to cr3447, selected by "026" or "029"
  argument on cyber.ini line.
- Changed several files to avoid gcc warning about oversized constants.
- Some optimizations in ppu and cpu emulation, particularly inlining.
- Added dumping of direct cells (as data) to ppu disassembly printout.
- Changed lp3000 to do space after rather than before, and to handle
  eject by outputting a formfeed character.
- Make operator display look better if you don't have CcDebug turned on.
- Suppress displaying of B0 in CPU trace output.
- Fix display bug in win32 output; also add display of channel trace mask.
- Change X11 display to use one-bit pixmap rather than screen depth.
- Fix "1CD gets stuck sometimes" bug in cr3447.
- Change lp3000.c to flush on a Release function if something was printed
  since the last time.  That way you can see job output without having
  to unload every time.
