Description of "ECOs" to the CDC 6600 wire lists

Issue: 1st char and 2nd char were being set when data is not character
data.

Cause: those signals derive from "data" which was latched from the 
I->S signal, which in turn comes from the Full signal (among others).
So it was the same width as the data being latched, meaning it would
pick up input from around the trailing edge of the data.  When
simulating only wire delays from long wires, this would not work.

Fix: add wire from D05 pin 21 to C10 pin 3.  That ANDs the II timing
pulse into the I->S signal, avoiding the hold issue.

Verified: in GHDL simulation run (cdc_tb2.vhd).
