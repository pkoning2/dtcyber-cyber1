Some notes on the simulation

The CDC 6600 uses negative logic (low voltage is logic 1, high voltage
is logic 0).  Coaxial transmission is somewhat of an exception: pulse
(which actually is a positive followed by a negative pulse, but the
negative one doesn't really matter) is logic 1, absence of pulse is 0.

In the model, the description is given in terms of logic values, not
voltage levels, so 1 is 1 and 0 is 0.  On the waveform viewer, 1 will
show up as the higher level.  That actually matches what the CDC
documents do; logic waveforms are shown that way, not as voltage
plots.

There is a set of type definitions and common entities in
cyberdefs.vhd.  Most of these correspond to the circles and squares in
the CDC logic diagrams.

The basic gate is called "NOR" by CDC, but they mean "not or" which in
standard terminology is NAND (and not).

The common entities in cyberdefs.vhd are:

1. inv -- an inverter.
2. inv2 -- two inverters in series.  CDC uses that for fanout
   (or perhaps for delay).  Both stages are provided as outputs.
3. g2 through g6 -- 2 to 6 input NAND gates.  A second output, which
   is the first output inverted, is also provided.
4. rsflop -- an RS flip-flop with up to 5 set and clear inputs,
   '0' is active.  These are shown in the CDC diagrams as
   cross-coupled gates, but attempting to model them that way
   creates oscilations and other messy things in the simulation.
5. latch -- a level-enabled latch (D flop).  This corresponds to
   the CDC RS flop with a clear-set network (two inverters in a 
   row, first inverter tied to the clear input, second gates the
   data input).  Again, trying to model the CDC diagram exactly
   is messy.  Also, modeling it as a latch is likely to give
   a better synthesis.  The behavior is not exactly the same;
   the CDC diagram has a glitch in it, and the Q and Qbar outputs
   are not changing at the same time.  But those oddities are
   not really interesting.
6. cxdriver -- a coax driver.  In the CDC drawings, the driver
   is electrically non-inverting but logically inverting, because
   a positive-going pulse is a '1' on the coax but a '0' elsewhere.
   To make waveforms easier to read, we model the coax driver 
   (and receiver) as inverters, so the logic level waveforms are
   consistent.  The full delay of a coax link (driver, cable,
   receiver) is modeled as a delay in cxdriver.
7. cxreceiver -- a coax receiver.  This is just an inversion to
   match the different logic conventions.

Other things defined in cyberdefs.vhd:

1. "t" -- the standard stage delay (5 ns).  Anytime we need to refer
   to stage delays, t or a multiple of t is used.  This will allow
   us to test what happens if t is zero -- if things still work then
   a synthesis will work, without the need to synthesize explicit 
   stage delays at every stage.  More likely some explicit delays
   will be needed in a few places if that is done, but hopefully
   only a very few.
2. coaxsig -- a subtype of std_logic used to identify coax pins
   as opposed to twisted pair pins.  (Twisted pair is std_logic.)
   The wirelist processor uses this to check correct pin assignment.

Modules

The majority of the .VHD files are module definitions.  Each module
goes into a separate file, whose name is the two-letter module name.
In general the modules are written as schematic style models
(components instantiated and hooked up by port maps).  Once in a while
it makes more sense to write behavioral models, but the goal is to
make the relationship between the model and the original design clear,
so the schematic approach is best.

All module pins must be "in" or "out" -- no "inout".  The wirelist
processor uses this to check correct wiring (in to out).  Coax pins
(double circle symbol) must be type "coaxsig"; other pins are
"std_logic". 

Some modules have pins connected to pullup resistors.  Those are
modeled as output pins with the output signal explicitly set to '0'.

Other .VHD files

Memory modules are modeled by a behavioral model in mem.vhd.  Memories
have two connectors; in the model those are done as pins 1-30 for the
first connector, and pins 101-130 for the second.

synchro.vhd is a simple model of a synchronizer, or more precisely, a
VHDL interface to dtsynchro.c which does most of the work.  This
models a synchronizer (an I/O device connected to a channel).  The
synchro entity has a generic "chnum" which is the channel number it
goes with.  There needs to be a matching device in the [vhdl] section
of the cyber.ini file -- that will be the simulated device connected
to this synchronizer.

As with mem.vhd, synchro.vhd has two connectors (19-pin connectors in
this case since coax has 19 wires in it): the first connector is for
the input cable, and the second for the output cable.  Pin numbers
101-119 are used on the output connector.

Wire list format

The wire list format is basically straight from the CDC documents.  It
lists the modules, one by one, with all the connections for each
module pin.  All the pins are mentioned even if no-connects.  For
memory, all 30 pins are shown; for other modules, only pins 1 to 28
are shown (the other two are power/ground).

Connections come in two basic forms: twisted pair, and coax.  Twisted
pair is given as the destination module (like "C21"), the destination
pin, and the length (in xxx units).  Coax is given as the cable id
(like "W02") and the wire in the cable (like "902").  Coax wire IDs
are 90 through 99 and 900 through 908 -- 19 wires per cable total.

A special case is destination pin "X" instead of a pin number.  That
is a ground (logic 1); the destination slot is always the current
slot, and the length is 2.  In the wirelist originals, the length is
sometimes omitted.

For memory, the power and ground connections are shown explicitly
(CB1, CB2, CB3, "+6 BUS").  For other modules they are omitted.

Each module in the wire list begins with a line that is the module
type and slot, like this:  "PX 1I25".  The leading number on the slot
is the chassis number.  Module type is the two-letter code or "MEM"
for memory.  That line is followed by the pin list (30 lines for
memory, 28 otherwise).  For memory, this is followed by a second
connector section with just a slot id (no module type) and another 30
pins -- those are the second connector.
