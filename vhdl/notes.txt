Some notes on the simulation

The CDC 6600 uses negative logic (low voltage is logic 1, high voltage
is logic 0).  Coaxial transmission is somewhat of an exception: pulse
(which actually is a positive followed by a negative pulse, but the
negative one doesn't really matter) is logic 1, absence of pulse is 0.

In the model, the description is given in terms of logic values, not
voltage levels, so 1 is 1 and 0 is 0.  On the waveform viewer, 1 will
show up as the higher level.  That actually matches what the CDC
documents do; logic waveforms are shown that way, not as voltage
plots.

A coax connection is modeled as a straight wire delay, without any
inversions in it.  That's basically sensible end to end (the coax link
with driver and receiver is non-inverting).  But it mixes up the
picture a bit, because the input to the driver is a 0-going pulse to
produce a coax pulse (which in turn produces a 0-going pulse out).  So
when viewed on a waveform viewer, coax signals will appear inverted
(steady high with low pulses).  That could be fixed but at the cost of
introducing the need to model two inversions, one at each end.  That
doesn't seem to be worth the trouble.
