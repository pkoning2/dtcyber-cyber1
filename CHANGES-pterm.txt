This file documents the major changes in each release of Pterm.

V5.0.0, April 2014:

Rewrite of the display engine to make zoom 200%, stretch, and full
screen mode work more consistently.

Copy/Paste text and related operations (such as execute browser) now
handle Unicode.  All PLATO characters, including accented characters,
are converted to/from Unicode.

New "Save GSW Audio" feature (in the File menu).  This allows you to
specify a file name (.WAV, .AIFF, or .AU type) to receive the next GSW
song.  Recording starts when the music starts, and stops when the
music is complete.  In other words, this captures one song at a time.
