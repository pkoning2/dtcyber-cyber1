This file documents the major changes in each release of Pterm.

V5.0.0, April 2014:

Rewrite of the display engine to make zoom 200%, stretch, and full
screen mode work more consistently.

Copy/Paste text and related operations (such as execute browser) now
handle Unicode.  All PLATO characters, including accented characters,
are converted to/from Unicode.

New "Save GSW Audio" feature (in the File menu).  This allows you to
specify a file name (.WAV, .AIFF, or .AU type) to receive the next GSW
song.  Recording starts when the music starts, and stops when the
music is complete.  In other words, this captures one song at a time.

Note to Windows users: the scaling of -font- text has been fixed for
consistency with other platforms.  If you have code that uses -font-
with sizes chosen to look right on the previous Windows version of
pterm, you will need to adjust the text size.  

V5.0.3, April 2014:

-paint- command now supports the case with a tag (fill with character
pattern).

V5.0.4, June 2014:

This is the release candidate of Pterm V5.0.

It contains bugfixes as well as a new feature: scale with aspect ratio
preserved (courtesy Dirk Thierbach).

V5.0.5, December 2014:

This is the release of Pterm V5.0.

It contains bugfixes, more general scaling, and Mac Retina display support.

V5.0.6, December 2014:

This release corrects several bugs: crash on exit primarily on Mac,
wrong handling of -font- commands in certain cases, extra newline in
autowrap mode.

V5.0.7, March 2015:

Bugfixes: block erase and mishandled Alpha channel in "xor" mode;
pasting a string with no spaces that requires more than one line wrap;
erasing text didn't clear it for the copy-text operation.
