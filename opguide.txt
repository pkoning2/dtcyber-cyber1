Quick CYBIS operator's guide				v0.0		04/09/07.

Here are some quick notes for common operator actions on CYBIS.

1. Startup.

The default is for Level 0 deadstart.  That is generally a good
choice.  

You can use level 3 deadstart under certain circumstances; that will
save a little time.  Level 3 deadstart is ONLY valid if:
     - be starting the SAME deadstart tape as last time.
     - last shutdown must have been a clean shutdown.

To do level 3 deadstart, enter the following at the first screen after
dtcyber startup (the *A* screen):

	O	 (*O* screen appears)
	P	 (*P* screen appears)
	I=3 <enter>     (I = 0 line changes to I = 3)
	enter
and then GO. at the "cmrinst" screen as usual.

1.1 Reinitializing ECS.

If the system (NOS or DtCyber) has crashed or is otherwise suspect
from the last time, it's a good idea to reinitialize ECS.  This is
done as part of a level 0 deadstart.  At the "cmrinst" screen, enter
the following:

    initialize,al,05. <enter>
    go. <enter>

The screen will go dark for 10 seconds or so; this is normal while NOS
initializes ECS.

If you've done a clean shutdown, ECS does not need to be initialized
(but there is no harm in doing so).  You also don't need to do it just
because the deadstart tape was changed.

2. Shutdown.

First back out PLATO (1 3 from author mode).  Then, at the console:

      k,mas1. <enter>
      k.stop  <enter>
      [	      (to erase the "k.")
      check point system. <enter>
      WAIT FOR "check point complete" message.  IMPORTANT!
      unlock. <enter>
      step. <enter>
      ALT-O
      shutdown. <enter>

2.1 Shutdown failures

Sometimes, if a PPU program is misbehaving, the "check point system"
step does not complete normally.  (Give it 15 seconds or so, but it
should complete fairly quickly.)  If that happens, do the following.
Do this right away, you get only one chance to do this and you
wouldn't want to wait till later and forget...

	ALT-O
	shutdown. <enter>
	<restart dtcyber>
	O P I=3 <enter>			(level 3 deadstart)
The "cmrinst" display will appear.  Enter:
	abort. <enter>
	(I don't believe you enter "go." after that, but if nothing
	happens, do that next.)
	
You should get a display that says "check point complete" somewhere.
Enter ALT-O and shutdown, then restart dtcyber and do a level ZERO
deadstart. 

3. Crashes.

If PLATO (CYBIS) dies, you will get the dread "plato off" display on
all the terminals.  A memory dump will be generated and sent to the
printer.  Mastor will automatically restart things.

If Conden dies, you may be able to restart it from the menu from 1 at
author mode.

If Framat dies, enter:
	  drop,pla1. <enter>
and things should restart.

If Mastor dies, shut down the system and restart.

In any of the above, wait for any line printer output to stop (BIO
status is IDLE).  Then do the following:

       ALT-O
       unload,12,5. <enter>
You'll get a message saying that LP was unloaded to some long file
name.  That's the line printer output up to this point; save it for
analysis. 

If DtCyber dies, hopefully we'll have a corefile; save that for
analysis.  In all cases, if you do a restart, make it a level zero
deadstart, with ECS initialized.
