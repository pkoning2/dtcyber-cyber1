Some quick notes.

1. On the first deadstart, do a level 0 deadstart.  At the CMRdeck
entry, type "next."  That brings up the EQPdeck instructions.
Type "initialize,AL,05." then "go."  That initializes ECS.

2. To start PLATO, type "x.cybis." at the console.  This generates a
LONG string of startup messages, but after about a minute things are
going.

3. Right now only the console works.

4. To start the console, type "x.console."  That brings up "lesson
desired" on the left screen and a keyboard layout on the right screen.
Note that LB (left blank) is the [ key -- that's the "function" key,
and RB which is ] is the shift key.

BACK "[ b" from "lesson desired" gets you to the author mode page.

5. Shutdown is as usual: From author mode, 1, then 3, then shift-help.

6. To exit console, type [ x .  Console stays active but you get the
NOS console back.  As usual, type * at the NOS console to go back to
the PLATO console program.

I haven't seen a way to actually stop the console program short of
dropping it.

7. The NOS V2 console commands are somewhat different from NOS V1.
The really big difference is that you do ALL operations on jobs by
their 4-letter name -- NOT by the control point number.  So, for
example, "DROP,AAAG." rather than "4.DROP.".

A smaller difference is that "check point system." requires that you
say "unlock." first.  That's a good change...

Another small difference is that you actually have to have the
K-display up to to K-display typein.  So you have to say K,MAS1. to
bring up the Mastor K display before you can say K.STOP or K.RELOAD.

Enjoy.
