DDP function codes

5001	     read ecs
5002	     write ecs
5004	     select status
5010	     master clear port

Read and write start by writing 2 words to the DDP, which
is the ECS address to access.  This is followed by an IAM 
or OAM of the desired word count (multiple of 5, of course).
If things went well, the I/O instruction terminates with A=0
and the channel still active.

If address bit 22 is set, for a read, that's "one reference" 
(one CM word?).

If address bit 23 is set, it's a flag register reference as usual.

If address bit 21 is set, that's "select maintenance mode" (???)


Status is one word:
xxx1	     ECS abort
xxx2	     ECS accept
xxx4	     ECS parity error
xx1x	     ECS write selected
xx2x	     channel parity error
xx4x	     6640 parity error
