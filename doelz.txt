Doelz net

The NIU has TWO channels, one for input, one for output.
These are given equipment names NI and NO respectively.

Function codes (on output channel)
	 0	deactivate network
	 1	activate network

Input data:

Input data arrives in blocks.  The block length is the primary
identifier of what type of data the block carries.  The PP is expected
to post a long read; the device will disconnect at the end of the
block. 

	   Length  Type
	     1	   Permission to send
	     7	   Key
	     9	   Supervisory
	     21	   Data block

Output data:

Output data also goes in blocks.  Each message type has a block
length, which along with the first word indicates what the block type
is.  Each block is transmitted by Output instructions ending with a
channel disconnect.

	   Length  Type				First word
	     1	   Abort			Network address
	     7	   Key				Network address
	     11	   Supervisory			1
	     n	   Data				Network address

Data messages contain some number of 20-bit words, and the block size
in PP words is X*20/12 + 1 rounded up, for X words.  X is at most 128,
so that yields a max data block size of 215 PP words including the
network address at the start.

Note that the supervisory message size outbound is different from the
size inbound.

Doelz exchanges:

PLF expects to hear an All Call message periodically -- the timeout is
50 ms.  Go figure.  It doesn't seem to do anything useful with these,
but it insists on them.  Any All Call message (ALCALM0 through 5) will
serve.







Protocol for Doelz over TCP:

The protocol by default uses socket 5005.  It carries the input and
output data streams.
